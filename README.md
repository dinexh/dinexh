Hi, I’m Dinesh Korukonda.

I build software by exploring how systems work, how tools can be made simpler, and how ideas turn into usable products. Most of my work sits at the intersection of backend engineering, developer tooling, and full-stack applications.


Alongside building software, I also write. On my website, I publish short pieces and long-form notes about software, systems, and the way I think about building things. My writing is an extension of my development work — a way to slow down, reflect, and explain ideas clearly. The latest writing can be found here:
