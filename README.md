Hi, I’m Dinesh Korukonda.

I build software by exploring how systems work, how tools can be made simpler, and how ideas turn into usable products. Most of my work sits at the intersection of backend engineering, developer tooling, and full-stack applications.

I’m currently experimenting with different ideas under the name *Monix* — focusing on engines, CLIs, and platforms that are meant to be practical, lightweight, and developer-first. I enjoy working close to the system when possible, but I’m equally comfortable designing web interfaces and APIs.

Alongside building software, I also write. On my website, I publish short pieces and long-form notes about software, systems, and the way I think about building things. My writing is an extension of my development work — a way to slow down, reflect, and explain ideas clearly. The latest writing can be found here:

I also take on freelance work, primarily developing websites and mobile applications, and helping teams improve their online presence through SEO and performance-focused engineering. I prefer projects where I can work closely with the product and contribute beyond just writing code.


Outside of code, I like breaking down complex problems, reading about how software evolves over time, and continuously refining how I think about building things.
