Hi, I’m Dinesh Korukonda.

I build software by exploring how systems work, how tools can be made simpler, and how ideas turn into usable products. Most of my work sits at the intersection of backend engineering, developer tooling, and full-stack applications.

I’m currently experimenting with different ideas under the name *Monix* — focusing on engines, CLIs, and platforms that are meant to be practical, lightweight, and developer-first. I enjoy working close to the system when possible, but I’m equally comfortable designing web interfaces and APIs.

This GitHub profile is a collection of experiments, projects, and long-term work. Some repositories are polished, others are learning spaces. I value clarity, maintainability, and understanding things deeply rather than rushing features.

Outside of code, I like breaking down complex problems, reading about how software evolves over time, and continuously refining how I think about building things.
